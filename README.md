# Whisper ONNX models

[OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) speech recognition models, exported to to ONNX using the [Whisper ONNX Exporter](https://github.com/echogarden-project/whisper-onnx-exporter) tool.

Each model tarball includes an `encoder.onnx` and `decoder.onnx` model files. They are mainly intended to be used from [Echogarden](https://github.com/echogarden-project/echogarden), but can also be used from other applications.

You can download the tarballs from the repository's 'releases' section.
